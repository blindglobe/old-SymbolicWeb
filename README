SymbolicWeb: Lisp and GUI'ish AJAX/Comet stuff
==============================================


Status
======

Alpha, and pretty much only interesting for developers of SW itself.



Notes
=====

DNS-scheme wrt. multiple "physical" servers and SW servers spread out amongst them:

  sw-server.physical-server.domain.org


DNS entries would look like;

  *.physical-server-1
  physical-server-1
  *.physical-server-2
  physical-server-2
  ...


The reverse proxy on each server will dispatch based on the "sw-server-x" part
of the URL.



/etc/rc.local
=============

sudo -i -u <username> "/usr/local/sbin/lighttpd -f ~/symbolicweb/data/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf"
sudo -i -u <username> "screen -d -m ~/symbolicweb/symbolicweb.sbcl --no-userinit --load ~/symbolicweb/start.lisp"
