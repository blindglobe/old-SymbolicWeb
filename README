SymbolicWeb: Lisp and GUI'ish AJAX/Comet stuff
==============================================


Status
======

Alpha, and pretty much only interesting for developers of SW itself.


Notes
=====

DNS-scheme wrt. multiple "physical" servers and SW servers spread out amongst them:

  sw-server.physical-server.domain.org


DNS entries would look like;

  *.physical-server-1
  physical-server-1
  *.physical-server-2
  physical-server-2
  ...


The reverse proxy on each server will dispatch based on the "sw-server-x" part
of the URL.
